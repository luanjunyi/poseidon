* BCMIncidentAssociationService
	⁃ Removed (BCMIncidentAssociationService updateIncident) method to align with server semantics which has addIncidentAssociation, but no update
	⁃ Added (BCMIncidentAssociationService addIncidentAssociation) method to add new association between primary and secondary incident to already created incident association.
	⁃ Added (BCMIncidentAssociationService refreshData) method to retrieve relevant fresh data from web service.
	⁃ Modified (BCMIncidentAssociationService deleteIncidentAssociation) method to take as parameters primary and secondary incidents ID to be disassociated

* BCMIncidentAssociationServiceTest
	⁃ Added (BCMIncidentAssociationService testAddIncidentAssociation) method to test add incident association
	⁃ Fixed all test methods

* NSManagedObjectContext+Utility
	⁃ Added (NSManagedObjectContext+Utility getObjectForEntityName) method to get object for entity by its ID

Up to Jan, 14, 2012
-------------------
* BCMIncidentAttachmentService
	⁃ Modified (BCMIncidentAttachmentService deleteIncidentAttachment) to operate within locked managed object context

* BCMIncidentAttachmentServiceTest
	⁃ Changed semantics of all BCMIncidentAttachmentServiceTest test cases to break its dependence on local data population code in (BCMSServicesTestCase setUp). All needed for testing data now generated locally.

* BCMIncidentAssociationService
	⁃ Added (BCMIncidentAssociationService refreshData) method to retrieve relevant fresh data from web service.
	⁃ All methods with data modification made within locked managed object context

* BCMIncidentAssociationServiceTest
	⁃ Added (BCMIncidentAssociationService testRefreshData) method to test refresh data
	⁃ All methods with data modification made within locked managed object context

* BCMUtilityService
	⁃ Removed (BCMUtilityService refreshData) method because there is no such method in ADS and there is no reason to have it due to the fact that all corresponding services has its own methods to refresh corresponding entities. And using refreshData methods of corresponding services only when needed greatly reduce amount of traffic and wait time for fresh data.

-------------------
* BCMSService
	⁃ Added (BCMSServicesTestCase updateObject:URI:withParent:token:error:) to treat update operations of child objects. This operations has such a specific that in response server returns full parent object description, which includes updated object too.

* BCMIncidentCategoryService
	⁃ Fixed (BCMIncidentCategoryService addIncidentCategoryContact) method
	⁃ Fixed (BCMIncidentCategoryService deleteIncidentCategoryContact) method
	⁃ Fixed bug in (BCMIncidentCategoryService updateIncidentCategoryContact) method. The submitted implementation assumed that amended contact object will be returned from server as result of this method invocation, but in fact actual data returned is full incident category definition for specified contact!!!!!

* BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest
	⁃ Fixed (BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest testAddIncidentCategoryContact) method
	⁃ Fixed (BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest testDeleteIncidentCategoryContact) method
	⁃ Fixed (BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest testUpdateIncidentCategoryContact) method

* BCMConveneRoomService
	⁃ Added (BCMConveneRoomService refreshData) method to retrieve relevant fresh data from web service.
	⁃ Fixed bug in (BCMConveneRoomService addConveneRoomContact) method. The submitted implementation assumed that amended contact object will be returned from server as result of this method invocation, but in fact actual data returned is full convene room definition for specified contact!!!!!
	⁃ Fixed bug in (BCMConveneRoomService updateConveneRoomContact) method. The submitted implementation assumed that amended contact object will be returned from server as result of this method invocation, but in fact actual data returned is full convene room definition for specified contact!!!!!

* BCMConveneRoomServiceTest
	⁃ Fixed all test methods method
	⁃ Added (BCMConveneRoomServiceTest testRefreshData) method to test refresh data

* BCMAreaOfficeServiceTest
	⁃ Fixed (BCMAreaOfficeServiceTest testDeleteAreaOfficeContact) method
	⁃ Fixed (BCMAreaOfficeServiceTest testUpdateAreaOfficeContact) method

* BCMAreaOfficeService
	⁃ All methods with data modification made within locked managed object context
	⁃ Fixed bug in (BCMAreaOfficeService updateAreaOfficeContact) method. The submitted implementation assumed that amended contact object will be returned from server as result of this method invocation, but in fact actual data returned is full area office definition for specified contact!!!!!

* BCMSService
	⁃ Removed obsolete parameter 'forEntityName' from  (BCMSService updateObject:URI:token:error:) method. It has no use - just garbage.

* BCMIncidentCategoryService
	⁃ Added (BCMIncidentCategoryService refreshData) method to retrieve relevant fresh data from web service.

* BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest
	⁃ Added (BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest testRefreshData) method to test refresh data
	⁃ Changed semantics of other BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest test cases to break its dependence on local data population code in (BCMSServicesTestCase setUp). All needed for testing data now generated locally.
	⁃ Fixed (BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest testCreateIncidentCategory) method
	⁃ Fixed (BCMIncidentCategoryServiceTest testDeleteIncidentCategory) method

Up to Jan, 10, 2012
-------------------
* BCMLookupService
	⁃ Added (BCMSService refreshData) method to retrieve relevant fresh data from web service.
	⁃ Added (BCMLookupService refreshUserGroups) method to retrieve user groups separately without authentication token. This will be used during login screen to display user groups list.

* BCMLookupServiceTest
	⁃ Added (BCMLookupServiceTest testRefreshData) method to test refresh data
	⁃ Changed semantics of other BCMLookupServiceTest test cases to break its dependence on local data population code in (BCMSServicesTestCase setUp). All needed for testing data now generated locally.

* BCMSEntitiesTestCase
	⁃ Added (BCMSEntitiesTestCase insertEntityFromFixture) utility method to insert managed entity which has been read from local JSON fixture into local managed objects context. This is heavily used by services testing 

* BCMAreaOfficeService
	⁃ Added (BCMAreaOfficeService refreshData) method to retrieve relevant fresh data from web service.
	⁃ Fixed bug in (BCMAreaOfficeService addAreaOfficeContact) method. The submitted implementation assumed that amended contact object will be returned from server as result of this method invocation, but in fact actual data returned is full area office definition for specified contact!!!!!

* BCMAreaOfficeServiceTest
	⁃ Added (BCMAreaOfficeServiceTest testRefreshData) method to test refresh data
	⁃ Changed semantics of other BCMAreaOfficeServiceTest test cases to break its dependence on local data population code in (BCMSServicesTestCase setUp). All needed for testing data now generated locally.

* BCMSService
	⁃ Removed obsolete parameter 'forEntityName' from  (BCMSService createObject:URI:token:error:) method. It has no use - just garbage.
	⁃ Added (BCMSService addObject:to:URI:token:error:) to implement add semantics for BCM web service access.

-------------------
* BCMSService
	⁃ Added (BCMSService refreshDataForEntity) method to implement common functionality for data refresh methods in other services.

* BCMUserService
	⁃ Added tests for all BCMUserService methods, except updateUser (obsolete method as agreed)
	⁃ Fixed (BCMUserService logout) by introducing userId parameter to align with remote web service endpoint
	⁃ Fixed bug in (BCMUserService searchUsersWith) method. The predicate for employee name was for exact match which rather too restrictive. Fixed by changing to CONTAINS predicate semantic which is more human preferred way of searching.
	⁃ Fixed bug in (NSManagedObjectContext+Utility fetchObjectsForEntityName) method returning wrong totalCount in result when filter predicate is set
	⁃ Introduced refreshData method which is in ADS but missed in submission.

* BCMHelpDocumentService
	⁃ Fixed bug in (BCMHelpDocumentService getHelpDocumentsWith) method. The filter predicate required exact match of user specified search text against document search text and have not included document short description at all. Fixed by relaxing filtering constraints with CONTAINS predicate semantic.

* BCMUtilityService
	⁃ Added tests for all BCMUtilityService methods
